I took on this project to compare Naive Bays with Support Vector Machine (SVM). This was to understand which model performs better with my dataset numbers. I discovered that:

1) The Naive Bayes model offered a more in-depth analysis of the purpose of the loan (provided more insights into the data, as it can be used to analyze the purpose of the loan, the FICO score, and the debt-to-income ratio)  as compared to the SVM which offered an analysis between fully paid loans vs not fully paid loans.
2) The Naive Bayes model showed an accuracy of around 80%, which is a good performance for a binary classification problem with a confidence interval of 95%. The model had a low sensitivity (6.1%), meaning it could not identify bad loans very well. On the other hand, the model had a high specificity (97.97%), indicating that it could most accurately identify good loans. This suggests that the model was better at identifying good loans than bad loans.
3) Conversely, the SVM model had an accuracy of 78%, slightly lower than the Naive Bayes model (80%). The model's confusion matrix showed a precision of 22.17% and a recall of (26.70%), indicating that it could not identify bad loans very well. It was just too low.

The project results showed that naive Bayes performed slightly better than SVM. This is likely because naive Bayes is a simpler model less prone to overfitting. Nevertheless, both models were good predictors of loan outcome.
